This is an Eclipse project.  You'll need to use at least Eclipse 3.4 and be 
setup for Android development.

The dependency on db4o was removed as it is too large for this small 
application.  The app is now 20k (compressed) vs 480k (compressed) with db4o.

The resource file should be automatically regenerated when you load the project 
in to Eclipse.
