This is an Eclipse project.  You'll need to use at least Eclipse 3.4 and be 
setup for Android development.

There is a dependency on db4o.  You'll need to download at least version 7.4 
from their website (http://db4o.com/). Create a folder called lib, but the db4o 
jar in to the lib folder and update the project classpath appropriately.

The resource file should be automatically regenerated when you load the project 
in to Eclipse.
